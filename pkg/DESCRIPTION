Description: Contains a suite of functions to analyze how speciation, extinction & character change contribute to biodiversity and display these relationships graphically.  The functions are designed to inform realistic models of clade evolution; examples are drawn from data on planktonic foraminifera or generated randomly.  Development is ongoing; paleoPhylo currently consists of graphical tools to plot paleobiological phylogenies incorporating stratigraphic uncertainty.
